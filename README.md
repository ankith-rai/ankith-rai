### Hi there 👋

I'm **Ankith Rai**,  
New here. A full-time Software Engineer, part-time bug whisperer, and occasional Airflow therapist.

---

🛠️ **What I do:**
- I tame ETL monsters with [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) (they scream less now)  
- I sling code in **Node.js** and **Python** like a caffeinated wizard
- I once made **Kubernetes** behave — still not sure how  

---

🚀 **Workday Ankith:**
- Automating all the boring stuff  
- Breaking things… then fixing them better  
- Leading integration projects like a CRM-ERP matchmaker  

🧠 **Weekend Ankith:**
- Solving [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/ankith-rai) puzzles to stay humble  
- Building side projects no one asked for (but everyone might need)  
- Daydreaming about distributed systems that actually make sense  

---

🌐 **Found lurking at:**
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankithrai97) – I’m professionally weird here  
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/ankith-rai) – where I pretend I enjoy recursion  
- [GitHub](https://github.com/ankith-rai) – you’re already here, let’s get awkward  

📫 **Let’s collab, meme, or debug life together:** [raiankith1@gmail.com](mailto:raiankith1@gmail.com)
